## Instagram scraper: Find viral posts on instagram

In the beginning of 2019, I was experimenting with niche pages on Instagram, and wanted an on-demand tool to find viral instagram posts of users in my niche. So, I created a small project to scrape viral posts from any instagram user.

There are various open-source projects such as [instagram-private-api](https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api) with more features like upload photo/video, manage follower/following, discover trending tags, etc.

For experimenting or automating workflow that requires such features, it is best to use of one these larger projects.

My main goal is to learn the process of inspection of web data, coupled with google search of course, to create a simple **read-only** tool to download best performing posts on instagram.

## What is a viral post

The word "viral" hints at what a viral post is. Viral posts are posts that have reached a much larger audience than regular posts. This is the dream of all content creators, marketers, or any creatives who want to grow their audience base.

The challenge is to sample a few viral posts and work backwards to determine what factors contributed to their virality.

While there are no sure ways to make a post go viral, there are guidelines on how to create a [viral marketing post](https://www.socialpilot.co/blog/10-types-of-post-for-viral-marketing) in general and [on instagram](https://whatskatieupto.com/2019/08/how-to-go-viral-on-instagram/).

## Determine whether a post is viral

From the engagement perspective, a viral post is one that has significantly higher engagement rate than other posts.

The definition of "significantly higher", "engagement rate" and "other posts" are up to us to decide.

I chose **50%** for "significantly higher", **number of likes** for "engagement rate", and **20 most recent posts** for "other posts".

In short, if a post has 50% more likes than the average number of likes of the 20 most recent posts, it is a viral post.

Of course, this is a naive solution as contextual information such as world and local events are missing.

## Workflow to find viral posts on instagram

1.  Retrieve user profile
2.  Extract the relevant information using data from the previous step
3.  Retrieve user's media(photo/video uploads)
4.  Calculate the engagement rate of the top 20 most recent posts using data from the previous step
5.  Filter for viral posts using data from step 3 and 4
6.  Save to file

In step 1 and 2, we determine **what** information we need and **where** to find them.  

In step 3, we figure out **how** to retrieve user's media by inspecting the HTTP requests.  
At this point, the bulk of the work on Instagram is done. What is left is to transform the user media data and save it to file.

Step 4, 5, and 6 will be skipped because they are trivial.

## 1. Retrieve user profile

The first step is to retrieve information on a user profile, like username, follower count, following count, etc.

Let's use **@9gag** as an example for this exercise.

Go to [https://www.instagram.com/9gag/](https://www.instagram.com/9gag/)


![9gag instagram](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654333165896/gBx6zVJc9.png align="left")


Fig 1. hmm much posts and followers

Right click on the page and go to "**View page source**", or hit **CTRL + U**. This brings us to the source code 9gag's profile.

To find out where to get the profile information, hit **CTRL+F** and search for "24136", which is the number of posts 9gag has.

![9gag instagram source page](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654333204188/rG4T-IcBU.png align="left")

Fig 2. found the needle in the sea of gibberish

It looks like we can get some profile information from 9gag's source, but there is also a lot of unrelated data surrounding it.

After spending a few minutes inspecting the file, we can figure out that all information of a user is stored under `window._sharedData`.


**Fig 3. start of the data block**
![9gag instagram shareddata start](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654333245301/eJtU4JpBq.png align="left")

**Fig 4. end of the data block**
![9gag instagram shareddata end](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654333408653/acll1gMBF.png align="left")

## 2. Extract the relevant information

Now that we have found out the place to look for user information, we need to extract them in order to do useful things.

The part of the data we are interested in is between the `{` after `window._sharedData` in Fig 3 and `}` at the end in Fig 4.

A pattern matching task means regular expression(regex) to the rescue!

Here is the magic pattern in javascript:

`/window._sharedData = (.*);/`

To try this out, copy the entire chunk of the `window._sharedData,` go to [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/), paste it under "test string" and the regex above under "regular expression".

The whole javascript object is matched and we have 9gag's profile information on hand now.

**Too much data!**

But there is one problem, there is way too much data than we need. To visualise the data better, we can use a [JSON prettifier](https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print).

Copy the entire javascript object, drop it in the json prettifier and click "make pretty".

**Fig 5. finally found the data we are after**
![9gag instagram shareddata json prettified](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654333106066/VEabXEM3Q.png align="left")

It became clear that the data we need is under `entry_data.ProfilePage[0].graphql.user`

## 3. Retrieve media uploads

This is the meat of the entire operation, and requires a little more inspection.

This time we will use the browser's network inspector and instagram's web API. Hit F12 or right click and go to "**Inspect**", select the "**Network**" tab, select "**XHR**" request type.

Still on 9gag's page, scroll down to trigger the spinning loader which will fetch more media. There will be an entry starting with `?query_hash=.....`. Double click on it and we will see the data for the first page of media.


**Fig 6. the request to retrieve user media**

**Fig 7. first page of 9gag's media**
![9gag instagram media query first page](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654333567835/FrY3WVeJG.png align="left")


**Deconstructing the media request**

The full URL for the media request is `https://www.instagram.com/graphql/query/?query_hash=bfa387b2992c3a52dcbe447467b4b771&variables=%7B%22id%22%3A%22259220806%22%2C%22first%22%3A12%2C%22after%22%3A%22QVFCUW0zWkVyMDhkcFlrYTFOeDM1dUU3UF9aM1pmejZDZGVwV0tBTTh0MC1XYnJVY1MxQ21jUE10N21MQUt6V0syM0h4S25Fb1N0R2MxaGxEd3pzcEtNSQ%3D%3D%22%7D`.

The URL is unreadable because it is encoded. To decode it, paste it in [https://www.urldecoder.org/](https://www.urldecoder.org/) and hit "**decode**", or use the javascript's built-in **decodeURIComponent** function:

`https://www.instagram.com/graphql/query/?query_hash=bfa387b2992c3a52dcbe447467b4b771&variables={"id":"259220806","first":12,"after":"QVFBRTg2Q2VlUjVFNnBQYzdCUjdSeXM3Z09rVjJCVW9QX1A4U2VQMU55a3dPdmZheEtOUTFrU2h4WTVUSlZRcW5ZV05GbW5BZEJ1YWhQZUZKNlFUd0lrcQ=="}`

There are 2 important components: `query_hash` and `variables`.

`query_hash` determines the type of operation, which in this case is media retrieval.

`variables` is a javascript object which consists of the user id(`id`), number of media to retrieve(`first`) and previous page's end cursor(`after`).

This way of data retrieval is known as [pagination](https://www.yaphc.com/pagination-deceptively-simple-task), a way to fetch a large amount of data in small batches in order not to overwhelm the server.


**Fig 8. simplified version of how pagination works**
![pagination intro](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654333782475/ceexBB6ZH.png align="left")


**Gotta get 'em all**

Now, we know how to construct the request to get media data, we just have to use `has_next_page` and `end_cursor` to retrieve the data until we are happy, or until instagram decides to activate the ban hammer. ðŸ™Š

Also, it looks like instagram imposes a limit of **50** items for each media page. So that's **483** requests to scrape all of 9gag's media.

If each request takes **1 second** to complete, and we add a random delay of **0.5 - 1.5 seconds** between each request, and ignoring everything else, it will take around **483 * (1 + 1) = 16** **minutes** to scrape all of 9gag's media.

## Tips to scrape instagram safely

There is always a risk that instagram may issue an IP ban(temporary and permanent) when hitting its server programatically.

However, there are some guidelines to make this venture less risky.

**1. Mimic human behaviour**

This is the most important tip. No human will make requests in the same exact way every time, e.g. pausing for some time after every request, making **50 requests per second**.

Add some random behaviour in the process. Pause for a random duration between 1-2 seconds after each request

Use common request headers to convince the server that the request comes from a real person using a web browser. Some of them are "**user-agent**", "**accept**", "**accept-encoding"**, "**referer**".

This article provides some useful tips on how to [avoid being blacklisted when scraping](https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-prevent-getting-blacklisted-while-scraping/) websites.

**2. Instagram's rate limit**

It was reported that the limit of media scraping is around **150-200 requests per 2 minutes**. It is good to keep this in mind and experiment with it.

**3. Instagram's soft IP ban**

Instagram gets angry when we make a lot of requests in a short period of time, especially as an unauthenticated user.

When that happens, one of these two things need to happen:

-   Wait it out
-   Figure out a way to make request as an authenticated user(I have not figured it out yet. [Help wanted](https://github.com/hanchiang/instagram-node-api/issues/16)?)

## Conclusion

This was a little fun project to pique my own curiosity in finding viral posts on instagram. I hope this post is useful to inspire people to experiment with web development.
